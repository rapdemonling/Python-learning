Yesterday when I was young
昨日当我年少轻狂
So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
有那么多甜美的曲儿等我歌唱
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
有那么多肆意的快乐等ling享受
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
还有那么多痛苦 我的双眼却视而不见
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
我飞快地奔走 最终时光与青春消逝殆尽
I never stopped to think what life was all about
我从未停下脚步去思考生命的意义
And every conversation that I can now recall
如今回想起的所有对话
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all
除了和我相关的 什么都记不得了
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
我用自负和傲慢玩着爱情的游戏
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
所有我点燃的火焰都熄灭得太快
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
所有我交的朋友似乎都不知不觉地离开了
And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah
只剩我一个人在台上来结束这场闹剧
Oh, yesterday when I was young
噢 昨日当我年少轻狂
So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
有那么那么多甜美的曲儿等我歌唱
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
有那么多肆意的快乐等ling享受
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
还有那么多痛苦 我的双眼却视而不见
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
我有太多歌曲永远不会被唱起
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
我尝到了舌尖泪水的苦涩滋味
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
终于到了付出代价的时间 为了昨日
When I was young
当我年少轻狂
